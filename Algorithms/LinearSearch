What is Linear Search?
Linear Search is the simplest search algorithm. It is used to find an element in an unordered or unsorted list by checking each element one by one, 
starting from the first element and going through each subsequent element until the desired item is found or the list is completely searched.

How Does Linear Search Work?
Imagine you have an array or list of items, and you want to find a specific item. With linear search, you would:
Start at the first element in the list.
Compare the current element with the item you're looking for (called the "search element").
If the current element is equal to the search element, return its index.
If the current element is not equal, move to the next element and repeat the comparison.
Continue this process until:
You find the element and return its index, or
You've gone through the entire list and the element isn't found, in which case you return -1 (indicating "not found").

ime Complexity
Best Case (O(1)): If the element you're looking for is at the very first position in the list, the search will only take one comparison.
Worst Case (O(n)): If the element is at the end of the list or not present at all, it will take n comparisons, where n is the number of elements in the list.
Average Case (O(n)): On average, if the element is somewhere in the middle, you will have to check about half of the elements.

Space Complexity
O(1): Linear search uses a constant amount of space, as it doesn't require additional memory besides the variables used for iterating through the list.

public class Linear {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		int[] arr = {12,14,15,23,42};
		int target = 12;
		int flag = 0;
		for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++) {
			if(target == arr[i]) {
				flag = 1;
				break;
			}
		}
		if(flag == 1) {
			System.out.println("Found");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Not Found");
		}

	}

}

output : Found

        int[] arr = {12,13,43,67,90};
        int result = linearSearch(arr);
        if(result != -1){
            System.out.println("Found at index: "+ result);
        }else{
            System.out.println("Not found");
        }
    }
    public static int linearSearch(int[] arr){
        int search = 13;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            if(arr[i]==search){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}

output:
Found at index: 1
