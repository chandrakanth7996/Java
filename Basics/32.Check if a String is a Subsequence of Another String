Write a program that checks if a given string is a subsequence of another string.
Constraints:
- The program should take two strings as input.
- The program should check if the first string is a subsequence of the second string.
- The program should print "Yes" if the first string is a subsequence of the second string, and "No" otherwise.
Example Input/Output:

- Input: str1 = "abc", str2 = "ahbgdc"
- Output: Yes

For example:
"abc" is a subsequence of "ahbgdc" because you can remove the characters 'h', 'g', and 'd' from "ahbgdc", leaving "abc" in the same order.
"axc" is not a subsequence of "ahbgdc" because you cannot find the characters 'a', 'x', and 'c' in that order in "ahbgdc".

- Input: str1 = "abc", str2 = "ahbgd"
- Output: No

import java.util.*;
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "abc";
        String str2 = "ahbgdc";
        
        int s1 = str1.length();
        int s2 = str2.length();
        int i=0,j=0;
        while(i<s1 && j<s2){
            if(str1.charAt(i) == str2.charAt(j)){
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        System.out.println(i==s1);
    }
}

Let's dry run the code with clear steps:
Input:
str1 = "abc"
str2 = "ahbgdc"

Step 1: Initialize variables

i = 0 (index for str1)
j = 0 (index for str2)

Step 2: Loop through str1 and str2

i = 0, j = 0
str1[i] = 'a', str2[j] = 'a'
Since they match, increment i: i = 1

i = 1, j = 1
str1[i] = 'b', str2[j] = 'h'
Since they don't match, increment j: j = 2

i = 1, j = 2
str1[i] = 'b', str2[j] = 'b'
Since they match, increment i: i = 2

i = 2, j = 3
str1[i] = 'c', str2[j] = 'g'
Since they don't match, increment j: j = 4

i = 2, j = 4
str1[i] = 'c', str2[j] = 'd'
Since they don't match, increment j: j = 5

i = 2, j = 5
str1[i] = 'c', str2[j] = 'c'
Since they match, increment i: i = 3

Step 3: Check if all characters in str1 have been matched

i = 3, which is equal to the length of str1
So, all characters in str1 have been matched

Step 4: Return the result

Since all characters in str1 have been matched, return true

Therefore, the output of the code will be:

true
