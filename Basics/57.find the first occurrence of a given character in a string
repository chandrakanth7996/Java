Write a Java program to find the first occurrence of a given character in a string.

Input:

- A string, e.g., "Hello, World!"
- A character, e.g., 'o'

Output:

The index of the first occurrence of the character in the string.

- If the character is found, output the index (0-based) where the character first appears.
- If the character is not found, output -1.

Examples:

- Input: "Hello, World!", 'o'
Output: 4 (because 'o' first appears at index 4)
- Input: "Java", 'x'
Output: -1 (because 'x' does not appear in the string)
- Input: "Mississippi", 's'
Output: 1 (because 's' first appears at index 1)


import java.util.*;
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "hello world";
        char ch = 'o';
        int index = indexCharacter(str,ch);
        if(index!=-1){
            System.out.println("Character '" + ch + "' found at index " + index);
        }else{
            System.out.println("Character '" + ch + "' not found in string");
        }
    }
    public static int indexCharacter(String str,char ch){
        return str.indexOf(ch);
    }
}

output:
Character o found at index 4
