Write a Java program that finds the missing number in an array of consecutive integers.
Input:
- An integer array arr = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output:
- 4 (because 4 is the missing number in the array)


import java.util.*;
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1,2,3,5};
        System.out.println(isMissing(arr));
    }
    public static int isMissing(int[] arr){
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            sum+=arr[i];
        }
        int n = arr.length+1;
        int res = (n*(n+1))/2;
        return res-sum;
    }
}

Explanation:
we first calculate the expected sum of consecutive integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the array plus 1 (because one number is missing). 
Then, we calculate the actual sum of the numbers in the array. 
Finally, we return the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum, which is the missing number.
