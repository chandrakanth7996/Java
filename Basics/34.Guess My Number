"Guess My Number" Game Specs
*Inputs and Outputs:*
* Inputs:
 + Player guess: integer between 1-100
* Outputs:
 + "Higher" - guess lower than hidden number
 + "Lower" - guess higher than hidden number
 + "Correct! You won in X attempts" - guess matches hidden number
 + "Game Over! Hidden number was Y" - 5 incorrect attempts exceeded
*Example Inputs/Outputs:*
1. Input: Guess = 50
 Output: "Higher" (if hidden number = 67)
2. Input: Guess = 67
 Output: "Correct! You won in 2 attempts"
3. Inputs: Guess = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (all incorrect)
 Output: "Game Over! Hidden number was 67"

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      Random random = new Random();
      int min = sc.nextInt();
      int max = sc.nextInt();
      int rand = random.nextInt(max-min+1)+min;
      System.out.println("Random number between "+min+" and "+max+" is "+rand);
    }
}

output: 
50
100
Random number between 50 and 100 is 78
