Check Divisibility | Check if a number is divisible by 2, 3, or both. |

import java.util.*;
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       int n = 280;
       if(n%2==0 && n%3==0){
           System.out.println("number is divisible by 2");
       }else if(n%3==0){
           System.out.println("number is divisible by 3");
       }else if(n%2==0){
           System.out.println("number is divisible by 2 and 3");
       }else{
           System.out.println("Invalid number");
       }
    }
}

Note: we should first check if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3, then check individual ones otherwise it 
will never be reached because if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0, it already printed and exited.

output:
number is divisible by 2 and 3
