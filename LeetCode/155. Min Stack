Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
Implement the MinStack class:
MinStack() initializes the stack object.
void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
int top() gets the top element of the stack.
int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.
Example 1:
Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2

class MinStack {
    private Stack<Integer> stack;
    private Stack<Integer> minStack;
    public MinStack() {
        stack = new Stack<>();
        minStack = new Stack<>();
    }
    
    public void push(int val) {
        stack.push(val);
        if(minStack.isEmpty() || val<=minStack.peek()){
            minStack.push(val);
        }
    }
    
    public void pop() {
        if(stack.peek().equals(minStack.peek())){
            minStack.pop();
        }
        stack.pop();
    }
    
    public int top() {
        return stack.peek();
    }
    
    public int getMin() {
        return minStack.peek();
    }
}

/**
 * Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MinStack obj = new MinStack();
 * obj.push(val);
 * obj.pop();
 * int param_3 = obj.top();
 * int param_4 = obj.getMin();
 */

Explanation:
To make the getMin() operation efficient, we use two stacks:
Main Stack (stack): Stores all elements, like a normal stack.
Minimum Stack (minStack): Keeps track of the minimum values at each point in time.

Whenever you push a value:
Add it to the main stack.
If itâ€™s smaller than or equal to the current minimum (or if minStack is empty), push it onto minStack as well.

Whenever you pop a value:
Remove it from the main stack.
If the popped value is the current minimum (the top of minStack), also pop it from minStack.
