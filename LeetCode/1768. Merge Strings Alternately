You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.
Example 1:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        int n1 = word1.length();
        int n2 = word2.length();
        StringBuilder mergeString = new StringBuilder();
        int i=0;
        while(i<n1 || i<n2){
            if(i<n1){
                mergeString.append(word1.charAt(i));
            }
            if(i<n2){
                mergeString.append(word2.charAt(i));
            }
            i++;
        }
        return mergeString.toString();
    }
}
