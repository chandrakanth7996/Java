String: A`String` is a sequence of characters that represents text and it is immutable, means it cannot be changed.

Two types of creation: 
	1) String literals
	2) new object

String literal: 
	eg: String s1 = "hello";
Java uses a special memory area called the "string pool" to optimize memory usage. When you create a string using string literals (e.g., `String str = "hello";`), Java checks the pool for an existing identical string. If it exists, it reuses the reference; if not, it creates a new one.

Note: No two strings have same value in a string pool.

new Object:
	eg: String s2 = new String("hello");
It is store in heap memory. 


simple program for == and equals():
	String s1 = "hello";
	String s2 = "hello";
	String s3 = new string("hello");
	System.out.println(s1 == s2); 	// true, because both are in string pool.
	System.out.println(s1 == s3);   // false, s3 is in heap memory.
	System.out.println(s1.equals(s3)); // true, it represents content.
