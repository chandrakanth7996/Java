https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/description/

You are given an integer mountain array arr of length n where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.

Return the index of the peak element.

Your task is to solve it in O(log(n)) time complexity.
Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,1,0]

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]

Output: 1
