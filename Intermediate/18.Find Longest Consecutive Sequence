Find Longest Consecutive Sequence | Find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive numbers. 

import java.util.*;
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2,5};
        System.out.println("Longest consecutive numbers: "+ longestConsecutive(arr));
    }
    public static int longestConsecutive(int[] arr){
        Set<Integer> hs = new HashSet<>();
        for(int num: arr){
            hs.add(num);
        }
        int count = 0;
        for(int num : arr){
            if(!hs.contains(num-1)){                                //Only start counting if it's the beginning of a sequence
                int currentNum = num;
                int currentStreak = 1;
            
                while(hs.contains(currentNum+1)){                      //Count consecutive numbers
                    currentNum++;
                    currentStreak++;
                }
                count = Math.max(count,currentStreak);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

output:
Longest consecutive numbers: 5

Explanation:
Steps to Find Longest Consecutive Sequence:
Create a HashSet
Add all numbers from the array into a HashSet to allow fast lookups.
Initialize longest = 0
This will store the length of the longest consecutive sequence found so far.
Loop through each number in the array
Check if the number is a sequence start
A number is the start of a sequence if (num - 1) is not in the set.
If it's a sequence start:
Set currentNum = num
Set currentStreak = 1
Count the length of the current sequence
While (currentNum + 1) exists in the set:
Increment currentNum and currentStreak
Update the longest streak
If currentStreak > longest, update longest
Continue until all numbers are processed
Return longest
This is the length of the longest consecutive sequence.
